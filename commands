Piping 

Piping is a technique used in command-line environments that allows the output of one command to be used as the input for another. This creates a sequence of operations where the data flows from one command to the next. Represented by the | symbol
   
if you want to get a list of files in a directory and then sort them by size, you could use the following command in PowerShell:
Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object Length



search file with specidifc extension 
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property "Extension" -eq ".txt" 
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property Extension -eq .txt 

-ne: "not equal". This operator can be used to exclude objects from the results based on specified criteria.
-gt: "greater than". This operator will filter only objects which exceed a specified value. It is important to note that this is a strict comparison, meaning that objects that are equal to the specified value will be excluded from the results.
-ge: "greater than or equal to". This is the non-strict version of the previous operator. A combination of -gt and -eq.
-lt: "less than". Like its counterpart, "greater than", this is a strict operator. It will include only objects which are strictly below a certain value.
-le: "less than or equal to". Just like its counterpart -ge, this is the non-strict version of the previous operator. A combination of -lt and -eq.


Get-ChildItem | Where-Object -Property "Name" -like "ship*"      to find files with ship in names of files

Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name,Length 


Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object Length -Descending | Select-Object -First 1    : here we piped the ls to sort it descending and piped again to sleetc object to show first 1
Get-ChildItem | Where-Object Length -gt 100 | Select-Object -Skip 2 -First 1   : skip 2 and display 3rd



Similar to grep in unix and findstr in windows : Select-String
Select-String -Path ".\captain-hat.txt" -Pattern "hat" 




Get-Computerinfo : get all very detail info of the system

Get-NetIPConfiguration : network info

Get-NetIPAddress cmdlet will show details for all IP addresses configured on the system, including those that are not currently active.

Get-Process provides a detailed view of all currently running processes, including CPU and memory usage, making it a powerful tool for monitoring and troubleshooting.

Get-Service allows the retrieval of information about the status of services on the machine, such as which services are running, stopped, or paused
